# TESTING

## Compatibility

The website was tested on Google Chrome and Safari web browsers to check functionality, responsiveness, and appearance.

## Responsiveness

The website was inspected using devtools to check its responsiveness, for example, the answer buttons on the quiz screen display split into two columns to make use of the extra space.

Additionally, the website's responsiveness on different devices has been tested using a Google Chrome extension called [Responsive Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/responsive-viewer/inmopeiepgfljkpkidclfgbgbmfcennb). The following devices were selected for testing:

- Galaxy S9, Note 8, S8 (360 x 740)
- iPhone 6/7/8 Plus (414 x 736)
- iPad (768 x 1024)
- Kindle Fire HDX (800 x 1280)
- Laptop (1280 x 800)

A [pdf](documentation/different-devices.pdf) generated by using a Google Chrome extension called [GoFullPage](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl) is available.
